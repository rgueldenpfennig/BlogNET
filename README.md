# BlogNET
BlogNET is a simple website renderer for various content sources implemented with .NET Core in C#.

## Install and how to
Coming soon :)

## Rendering
For now it is planned to render the provided content via [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). Maybe it is possible to support other frameworks like Angular or React in the future for displaying the website.

## Content
The content of the deployed website is going to be provided through various ways. At first I'm going to implement a file storage based provider where the page contents are served via markdown and/or JSON files.

Prospectively there will be additional providers like Contentful, databases or generic web APIs.

It should be possible to easily configure the desired content provider in the main rendering application.

## Motivation
In the first place I want to try out new things to keep up-to-date with technology trends, progamming methodologies and best pracices.

Furthermore I would like to replace my WordPress based website with someting self builded and maintained. WordPress has lots of downsides like security issues and too much possibilites which I just don't need. And I think most websites don't either.
